# EE2026-Digital-Design

This module introduces fundamental digital logic, digital circuits, and programmable devices and provides us with an understanding of the building blocks of modern digital systems and methods of designing, simulating and realizing such systems. The emphasis of this module is on understanding the fundamentals of digital design across different levels of abstraction using hardware description languages, and developing a solid design perspective towards complex digital systems.

## Code Information

The Hardware Description Language (HDL) of Verilog was used for lab assignments. Xilinx Vivado was used as the programming environment.

## Final Project

At the end of the module, we were tasked to create an Entertainment and Sound System as our final project. It was worked on in pairs and we were given creative freedom limited to the project kit of a Digilent Basys 3 Board, Pmod OLEDrgb 96 x 64 RGB OLED Display, Pmod MIC3.
