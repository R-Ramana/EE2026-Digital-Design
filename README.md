# EE2026-Digital-Design

This module introduces fundamental digital logic, digital circuits, and programmable devices and provides us with an understanding of the building blocks of modern digital systems and methods of designing, simulating and realizing such systems. The emphasis of this module is on understanding the fundamentals of digital design across different levels of abstraction using hardware description languages, and developing a solid design perspective towards complex digital systems.
